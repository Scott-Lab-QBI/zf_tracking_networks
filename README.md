This repository is a companion to the project and preprint:

**Scholz LA, Mancienne T, Stednitz SJ, Scott EK, Lee CCY** (2025) *Plug-and-Play automated behavioral tracking of zebrafish larvae with DeepLabCut and SLEAP: pre-trained networks and datasets of annotated poses.* bioRxiv DOI: [10.1101/2025.06.04.657938](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.04.657938) 

The four exported models result of our work are available for download directly from: 

**Scholz, Leandro Aluisio; Lee, Conrad; Stednitz, Sarah; Mancienne, Tessa; Scott, Ethan** (2025). *DLC and SLEAP pre-trained exported models.* The University of Melbourne. Software. DOI: [10.26188/29275838](https://doi.org/10.26188/29275838) 

We also provide the annotated datasets used to train and compare the models. These should be available soon.
